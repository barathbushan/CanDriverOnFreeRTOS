/******************************************************************************
 * The FreeRTOS+IO and FreeRTOS+CLI features mentioned in these comments are
 * documented on the following two URLs:
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_IO/
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_CLI/
 *
 * It is essential that jumpers are set correctly.  The required jumper
 * settings are pictured on the documentation page for this demo, which
 * can be located from the following URL:
 * http://www.FreeRTOS.org/FreeRTOS-Plus/FreeRTOS_Plus_IO/Featured-FreeRTOS_Plus_IO_Demos.shtml
 ******************************************************************************
 *
 * This demo provides the following functionality:
 *
 * --- Command Console ---
 * FreeRTOS+IO and FreeRTOS+CLI are used to create a command console. UART3 is
 * used for input and output.
 *
 * The FreeRTOS+IO zero copy transfer mode is used to transmit characters, and
 * the interrupt driven character queue transfer mode is used to receive
 * characters.
 *
 * The application registers the following commands:
 *
 *	+ "echo-parameters".  This command accepts a variable number of parameters.
 *    Each parameter entered is echoed back individually.
 *
 *	+ "echo-three-parameters".  This command is similar to "echo-parameters",
 *    but will only accept exactly three parameters.
 *
 *  + "task-stats".  This command displays a table that includes a line for each
 *    executing task.  The table displays information including the task state,
 *    and the task's stack high water mark.  (the closer the stack high water
 *    mark value is to zero the closer the task has come to overflowing its
 *    stack).
 *
 *	+ "run-time-stats".  This command also displays a table that also includes
 *    a line for each executing task.  This time the table displays the amount
 *    of time each task has spent in the "Running" state (actually executing).
 *    Both absolute and percentage times are shown.  See
 *    http://www.freertos.org/rtos-run-time-stats.html
 *
 *	+ "create-task".  This command takes a single numerical parameter.  It
 *     creates a new task and passes the command line parameter into the task as
 *     the task parameter.  The task that is created displays the parameter value
 *     on the command console.  The "task-stats" command can be used both before
 *     and after executing the "create-task" command to see the newly created
 *	   task appear in the table of running tasks.
 *
 *	+ "delete-task".  This command deletes the task that was created by the
 *    "create-task" command.
 *
 *
 * By default, UART3 is set to 115200 baud, no start bits, 8 data bits and 1
 * stop bit. UART3 is routed, via a UART to USB converter, to the micro USB
 * connector marked X3 on the LPCXpresso base board.
 *
 * --- Display Driver ---
 * FreeRTOS+IO is used to implement a display driver for the OLED display.
 * The OLED is configured for I2C operation, and uses the I2C2 peripheral.
 *
 * The example demonstrates the I2C port being used in the polled and
 * interrupt driven zero copy transfer modes.
 *
 * --- Serial EEPROM Interface ---
 * FreeRTOS+IO is used to write to, then read back from, an EEPROM that is
 * connected to the I2C2 peripheral.
 *
 * The example demonstrates the I2C port being used in the polled and interrupt
 * driven zero copy transfer modes to write to the EEPROM, and the polled and
 * interrupt driven circular buffer transfer modes to read back from the
 * EEPROM.
 *
 * --- 7-Segment Display ---
 * FreeRTOS+IO is used with an SPI peripheral in the polled transfer mode to
 * periodically write an incrementing number to a 7-segment	display.
 *
 * --- GPIO ---
 * FreeRTOS software timers are used to periodically toggle the multi-coloured
 * LEDs.
